# Practicum Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Web Development program at Practicum by Yandex. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

* Semantic HTML5
* Flexbox
* Positioning
* Flat BEM
* A custom form
* CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

- Potentially switch layout of the page to go from a one-page spread to a multi-page experience
- Create an ordering block where customers could place an advance order for the type of coffee they'd like on top of the table booking section
